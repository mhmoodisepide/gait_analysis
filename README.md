# Gait Analysis Project 

## Purpose:
Learning how to create and analyze simple synthetic gait data at home using Python.  
This project is part of my personal learning to understand gait signals and how to work with them using basic tools.

---
## Whatâ€™s Included So Far
- Generated synthetic gait signals for right and left foot motion
- Visualized height trajectories for both feet
- Detected heel-strike events:
  - Right foot only
  - Both feet together on a single graph
- Computed gait metrics:
  - Stride time
  - Cadence (steps per minute)
- Implemented toe-off detection to complement heel-strike events
- Performed symmetry analysis between right and left foot
- Analyze and visualize joint kinematics using Python

---

## What I'm planning to add:

- Explore joint kinematics (hip, knee) across varying walking speeds
- Investigate correlations between walking speed and joint motion
- Improve gait event detection and data visualization
- Incorporate real gait data if available in future


---

## Tools used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy

---

## How to run the project:

1. Install the required packages
2. Then open the notebook in Jupyter

 **Note:** All the data in this project is synthetic and was created just for practice and testing.
