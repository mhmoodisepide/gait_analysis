# Gait Analysis Project 

## Purpose:
Learning how to create and analyze simple synthetic gait data at home using Python.  
This project is part of my personal learning to understand gait signals and how to work with them using basic tools.

---

## Whatâ€™s included so far:
- Created synthetic signals for right and left foot motion
- Plotted height trajectories for both feet
- Detected heel strike points:
  - For right foot
  - For left foot
  - Both together in one graph

---

## What I'm planning to add:
- Gait metrics like step time, stride time, cadence
- Toe-off detection
- Symmetry analysis between right and left foot
- Maybe real gait data later if available

---

## Tools used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn

---

## How to run the project:

1. Install the required packages
2. Then open the notebook in Jupyter

---

 **Note:** All the data in this project is synthetic and was created just for practice and testing.
